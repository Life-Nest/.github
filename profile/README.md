# Life Nest - Incubator Management System

Life Nest is a comprehensive system designed to streamline incubator organization and reservation for hospitals and parents. This repository encompasses both the backend API and the mobile application components.

## About Life Nest

Life Nest empowers hospitals to efficiently manage their incubators and simplify the reservation process for parents.

## Benefits for Hospitals:

- **Centralized Incubator Management:** Maintain a clear overview of available incubators and their status.
- **Simplified Reservation System:** Streamline the reservation process for parents and staff.
- **Improved Efficiency:** Reduce administrative tasks and dedicate more time to patient care.

## Benefits for Parents:

- **Convenient Reservation Management:** Secure and manage reservations with ease.
- **Enhanced Communication:** Receive timely updates and communication from the hospital staff.

## Project Components

This repository holds two key components:

1. **Backend API** - Built using JavaScript and Express for robust handling of API requests. Prisma provides interaction with the database for data storage and retrieval.
2. **Mobile App** - Developed using Flutter, a cross-platform framework, allowing deployment on both iOS and Android devices.

## Target Users:

- **Hospital Staff:** Manage incubators, view reservations, and interact with parents.
- **Parents:** Search for available incubators, make and manage reservations, and receive updates.

## Getting Started

Please refer to the dedicated README files within each project repository (backend and mobile app) for detailed setup instructions specific to each platform.

Here are some general guidelines:

- **Backend API:**
  - Node.js and npm are required.
  - A database server compatible with Prisma is needed (refer to Prisma documentation for supported options).
- **Mobile App:**
  - Flutter development environment needs to be set up.

Both components will require configuration details (e.g., database connection) stored in environment variables.
